B00142477 - Alexander Perry: Cyber Security Training Game

* This project slightly deviates from the 'Game' genre, but still fits within accepted project genres such as a learning environment, a computerised test and web-based learning/training. The project is 3D, the player is incentivised to progress through the game using a points system, and a reaction in the mini game. Once the questions are loaded in for the final version the difficulty will also increase by means of harder quiz questions.

* When finished, "Iron Arcade" will serve as a gamified way to raise awareness about cyber security and improving online practises in the workplace and at home.
